<p>I trained in medical physiology for my PhD, and my graduate and post-doctoral research focused on comparative enzymology and non-mammalian cancer genetics. While at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and the Marine Biological Laboratory, I investigated some of the basic science behind molecular biomarkers for use in wild populations. As an independent school educator and director of science research at Riverdale Country School in The Bronx, I became interested in the molecular basis of stress adaptation for wild species. This research area has proved fruitful in multiple ways. Working as a team, with high school students, we have received external grant support and published our findings regarding molecular adaptation across broad ranges of environmental stressors. Most importantly, direct involvement in this hands on field based research has empowered young people at the high school level to take on some of the most critical questions of our time.</p>

<p>I am specifically interested in the molecular basis of adaptive processes that allow organisms to cope with various stressors such as urbanization and climate change. Research in my lab merges urban ecology and field biology with subcellular and molecular analysis. We are most interested in addressing the ways in which the epigenome controls adaptation and evolution. We collect empirical data based on novel model systems that include wild populations of molluscs and plants. I am especially interested in understanding how transient epigenetic changes can drive evolutionary change.</p>
