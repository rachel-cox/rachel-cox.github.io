I"–<p>Our research goals at the  Lisman Lab are to better understand molecular pathways involved in stress response of wild populations. As part of our interest in urban stress, we established a long term research site at our local watershed, the Bronx River. We are also interested in studying the stress response due to climate change and for this research, we collaborate with Columbia University colleagues on wild populations from arctic Alaska and <a href="https://www.blackrockforest.org/">Black Rock Forest, New York.</a></p>
