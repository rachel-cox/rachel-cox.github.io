I"7<p>At Riverdale Country School, I teach upper school science and philosophy and I oversee research at the Lisman Laboratory for Molecular Ecology, housed in the Science Department at the school. I advise students on summer research activities and internships, and help to organize Riverdaleâ€™s Annual Student Science Symposium. I co-lead field work, outdoor leadership, and science conference trips. At Columbia University, I collaborate in the field and in the lab, with faculty and students from the Department of Ecology, Evolution and Environmental Biology.</p>
