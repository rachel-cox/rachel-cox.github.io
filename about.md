I’m a science educator and director of science research at [Riverdale Country School](https://www.riverdale.edu/) in The Bronx and an Adjunct Associate Research Scientist in the [Department of Ecology, Evolution and Environmental Biology (E3B)](http://e3b.columbia.edu/faculty/rachel-cox/) at Columbia University in New York.

I oversee the activities of the [Lisman Laboratory for Molecular Ecology at Riverdale Country School](https://www.riverdale.edu/2015/09/08/summer-science-research/) and advise students on [summer research activities and internships.](https://www.rockefeller.edu/outreach/lab-initiative/summer-science/highschoolapp/
) I help to organize the Riverdale’s annual [Student Science Symposium](https://www.riverdale.edu/events/science-symposium/) and I co-lead [field work](https://inspirationlab.org/story/7247), outdoor leadership, and science conference trips.    

I received my BA in Biology from Reed College, my MA in Pathbiology from University of Washington School of Public Health, and my PhD in Physiology from Boston University School of Medicine. My dissertation research into comparative enzymology of nitric oxide synthase was carried out under the mentorship of John Stegeman, Biology Department, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute. My postdoctoral research on molluscan oncogenes was carried out at the Marine Biological Laboratory under the mentorship of Carol Reinisch.
